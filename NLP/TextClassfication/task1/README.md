# Examples for training text classification
## Models
Using the following method to predict the dataset:
+ [TextCNN(Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882)
+ [TextRNN(Recurrent Neural Network for Text Classification with Multi-Task Learning)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05101)
+ [RCNN(Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification)]()

## Dataset
We use some binary and multi-labels classification dataset, details for dataset in the project description file.
